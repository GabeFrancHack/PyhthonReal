#The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written in the following format, the month times the day equals the year:

m=int(input('enter the month:'))
d=int(input('enter the date:'))
y=int(input('enter the last 2 digits of the year:'))
print()
if m*d==y:
    print('this date is magic')
elif m*d != y:
    print('this date is not magic')
