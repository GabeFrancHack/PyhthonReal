#Write a program that lets the user play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The program should work as follows:
#1. When the program begins, a random number in the range of 1 through 3 is generated.
#If the number is 1, then the computer has chosen rock. If the number is 2, then the
#computer has chosen paper. If the number is 3, then the computer has chosen scissors.
#(Don’t display the computer’s choice yet.)
#2. The user enters his or her choice of “rock,” “paper,” or “scissors” at the keyboard.
#3. The computer’s choice is displayed.
#4. A winner is selected according to the following rules:
#•	 If one player chooses rock and the other player chooses scissors, then rock wins.
#(Rock smashes scissors.)
#•	 If one player chooses scissors and the other player chooses paper, then scissors wins.
#(Scissors cuts paper.)
#•	 If one player chooses paper and the other player chooses rock, then paper wins.
#(Paper wraps rock.)
#•	 If both players make the same choice, the game must be played again to determine
#the winner.
