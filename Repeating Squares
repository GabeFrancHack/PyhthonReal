##In this chapter, you saw an example of a loop that draws a square.
 #Write a turtle graphics pro- gram that uses nested loops to 
#draw 100 squares, to #create the design shown in Figure 4-13.

import turtle
turtle.speed(10)
#changing base/height of square function
#square function
def square(b):
    turtle.forward(b)
    turtle.left(90)
    turtle.forward(b)
    turtle.left(90)
    turtle.forward(b)
    turtle.left(90)
    turtle.forward(b)
    turtle.left(90)
for x in range(0,202,2):
    square(x)

turtle.exitonclick()
