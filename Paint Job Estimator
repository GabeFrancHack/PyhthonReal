#A painting company has determined that for every 112 square feet of wall space, one gallon
#of paint and eight hours of labor will be required. The company charges $35.00 per hour
#for labor. Write a program that asks the user to enter the square feet of wall space to be
#painted and the price of the paint per gallon. The program should display the following data:
#• The number of gallons of paint required
#• The hours of labor required
#• The cost of the paint
#• The cost labor
#• The total cost of the paint job
