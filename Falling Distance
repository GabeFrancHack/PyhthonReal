#. Falling Distance
#When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
#d = ½ gt^2
#The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the
#amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
#Write a function named falling_distance that accepts an object’s falling time (in seconds)
#as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has
#fallen during that time interval. Write a program that calls the function in a loop that passes
#the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.
